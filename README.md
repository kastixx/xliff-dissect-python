This repository will contain simple scripts for:

* splitting [XLIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF) files
  into chunks N segments each and extracting attachments
* doing the opposite (i.e., merging chunks and attachments
  into one file)

Currently it is on very early development stage. Do not expect much.
